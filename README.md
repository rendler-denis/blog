# Ronald's Blog

This blog is hosted on my GitHub pages site [ronaldbosma.github.io](https://ronaldbosma.github.io).

The blog site is created using [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.com/) and styled with the [Mediumish theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/mediumish-gohugo-theme/).

Code examples used in my posts can be found [here](https://github.com/ronaldbosma/blog-code-examples).

I've also written a blog post on [building and releasing a Hugo site with Azure Pipelines](https://ronaldbosma.github.io/blog/2019/03/24/build-and-release-hugo-site-using-azure-pipelines/).
